    <h1>Vegan Croissants ü•ê</h1>

    <p>
      Croissants are a delight whether served for breakfast or brunch, but
      sadly, that is not something a vegan-from-birth could ever know because
      croissants are not vegan! A description of a good croissant is more or
      less legally required to include the words buttery and flaky and, as
      anyone who has ever watched The Great British Bake Off will know, it is
      the butter that is vital to the lamination that creates the flaky texture.
      It is also pretty vital to the buttery-ness! Whilst even non-bakers will
      probably know that a croissant contains butter (and lots of it!), perhaps
      not everyone would be aware that the initial dough that is then layered
      with the butter also includes milk. But the non-vegan ingredients in
      croissants don‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶ Is a croissant the most non-vegan item in the
      bakery, you might ask? Luckily there have been many bakers experimenting
      with the recipe so nowadays you can find pretty amazing vegan croissants!
